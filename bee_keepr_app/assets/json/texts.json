Keep the containers in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, as exposure to heat and light can degrade honey’s color and flavor over time. Ideal storage temperatures are between 50°F and 70°F (10°C and 21°C). Avoid storing honey in the refrigerator, as this can cause crystallization.\n\nIf honey does crystallize, it can easily be returned to a liquid state by gently warming the container in a water bath, ensuring the temperature does not exceed 104°F (40°C) to preserve its natural enzymes. This sublesson explains the best practices for storing honey, helping you maintain its quality and enjoy your harvest for months or even years to come."
